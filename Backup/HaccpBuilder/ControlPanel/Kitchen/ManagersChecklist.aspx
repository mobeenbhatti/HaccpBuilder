<strong><span style="font-size: small;">CLEANING AND SANITATION</span></strong><br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b><br />
1. Pre-operational sanitation.</b> All equipment will be cleaned and sanitized prior to starting production. Sanitizer concentration must be measured and documented at least once daily. If sanitizer buckets are used for wipes or utensils, the concentration must be checked and recorded at least every 4 hours during production.  There will be a daily sanitation inspection of production lines before operations begin.<b> This will be recorded in the online Food Safety Check List (which can be customized to your specific needs).<br />
</b></span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b><br />
2. Cleaning and sanitizing of utensils and equipment</b> shall be conducted so as to protect against contamination of food, food contact surfaces, or food packaging materials. Food contact surfaces will be cleaned following contact with allergen-containing foods. If high temperature sanitization is used instead of chemical sanitization, water temperatures must be measured and recorded for each cleaning cycle<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A. A written cleaning and sanitation program for all equipment and premises (production and storage areas) will be followed.<b> (online Food Safety Check List can be customized to your specific needs).</b> The program includes: the name of the responsible person; the frequency of the activity; the procedures for cleaning and sanitizing; the chemicals and concentrations used; the temperature requirements; and the type and frequency of inspection to verify the effectiveness of the program.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Sanitary procedures for cleaning and sanitizing equipment are used<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. The equipment is disassembled. Parts are placed in designated washing tubs, racks, sinks.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Product debris is removed. <br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Equipment parts are rinsed with potable water.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Equipment is sanitized with approved sanitizer and rinsed with potable water if required.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. Equipment is reassembled. <b>(See online Food Safety Check List to customize to your establishment.  All equipment maintenance by equipment item can have a specific question assigned for safety check and notation of corrective actions</b>.)<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. Chemicals will be used in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D. The sanitation program will be carried out in a manner that does not contaminate food or packaging materials during or following cleaning and sanitizing (e.g. aerosols, chemical residues). <br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E. Implementing, monitoring, and record keeping. The QC manager performs daily visual sanitation inspection after preoperational equipment cleaning arid sanitizing. The results of the inspection are recorded in the <b>online Food Safety Check List (this can be customized in HACCP Builder to your needs</b>). If everything is acceptable, the appropriate box is initialed. If corrective actions are needed, such actions can be updated on the Food Safety Check List.  NOTE: Operations will begin only after sanitation requirements are met.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F. Corrective action must be taken, based on visual inspection of equipment and premises. Evidence of improper cleaning is, but not limited to: food particles, grease build-up (either yellow gummy or carbon) soap or water residue on surfaces, mold, dust, oxidation of metals. The Quality Control (QC) person will mark type and area of concern on the checklist. This information will then be given to the person assigned to clean. Once the cleaning is completed, the QC person will re-inspect and make notation with the Food Safety Check List based on the time cleaning was completed.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><b><br />
3. Sanitation of food contact surfaces</b>. Cleaning and sanitizing of utensils and equipment shall be conducted so as to protect against contamination of food, food contact surfaces, or food packaging materials.<br />

</span><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;">PEST CONTROL PROCEDURE PLAN</span></strong></span><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
</span></strong></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
1. There is removal of litter, waste, and cutting grass and weeds within the immediate vicinity of the buildings I structures to prevent breeding I harborage of pests.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">2. There is inspection of the plant and extermination or other means to exclude pests, dirt, and filth that could contaminate food if neighboring grounds are not under the operators control, and are not maintained as above.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
3. No pets shall be allowed in any area of the food plant.  Guard or guide dogs shall only be allow in some areas where the presence of the dogs is unlikely to contaminate food, food contact surfaces, or food packaging materials.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
4. Effective measures to exclude pests from processing areas and to protect against food contamination on the premises shall be taken.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
5. Use of insecticides or rodenticides shall be used as defined by law and permitted only under precautions and restrictions that will protect against contamination of food, food contact surfaces, and food packaging materials.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
6. Documentation as part of a pest control program shall be  maintained.<br />
</span></span><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
PEST CONTROL PROGRAM<br />
</span></span></strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
1. A systematic pest control program is essential to prevent adulteration. If the facility is dirty no amount of pest control chemicals will prevent or stop insect and rodent infestation.  (<b>A Pest Control Schedule and Report should be implemented in your online Food Safety Check List.</b>)<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp;A. The entire production facility is inspected regularly for any evidence of pests. <br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Storage areas are kept clean and free of debris and spilled food, which serve as a breeding area for pests<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Doors, windows, screens, walls, and floors are clean and well maintained so that pests cannot find a way into the establishment<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
2. The use of properly cleaned and sanitized insect- and rodent-proof, covered trash containers discourages pest breeding. Floor drains are properly trapped to prevent insect and rodent entry.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
3. All food items will be kept in closed, labeled containers and carefully inspected as received for evidence of pests before they are stored. Fresh ingredients are not added to old ingredients. For example, if flour from the bottom of the container of flour in dry storage contains flour beetles, a new supply of flour will become contaminated with beetles, if it is added to the old supply of flour.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
4. If pests are discovered, immediate steps are taken to eliminate them.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
5. HACCP requires verification by a supervisor or higher-level person that service provided by a pest control company was performed fully. This is done when the HACCP team does a monthly inspection of the facility.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
6. Pest control reports are normally kept for six months.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
7. Material Safety Data Sheets are kept and available for all pesticides used on the premises.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
8. If traps are used to trap rodents, a Floor Plan must be made that indicates the location of these devices and the type of bait in each trap. (This needs to be based on an actual your blueprint/floor plan of your organization.)<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
9. Pesticides must be used correctly. Any commercial chemicals used for pest control are toxic when not used correctly. <b>A pest control chemical list will be maintained in your online Food Safety Check List</b>).<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
10. All food supplies must be placed in covered containers or removed from the area during pesticide application. All food contact surfaces must be covered or washed, rinsed, and sanitized after pesticide application.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
11. Gaps around doors must be 1/4 inch or less.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
12. All vendors must operate an effective pest control program.  Service for outdoor poison bait must be monthly (licensed PCO only) and twice monthly for indoor rodent catch traps. Fly lights must be inspected and cleaned weekly.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
13. Records must include a current business license from the pest control company, a certificate of liability insurance from pest control company, service records that specify the date of service, the nature of the service, and any observations or corrective actions that are necessary, an activity Jog for all devices, and a current device map with numbered locations and a legend that includes mechanical rodent traps, toxic bait stations, and insect lights. All toxic bait stations must be anchored to the ground and tamper proof.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
14. A. chemical application log must be kept by the pest control service technician and MSDS for all chemicals, including pesticides; toxic bait. glue boards, etc., must be kept on file<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
15. All outdoor toxic bait stations must be anchored to the ground, tamper resistant, numbered, and located at least every 50 linear feet around the building.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
16. Indoor mechanical craw ling pest devices must be numbered and located every 25 to 30 linear feet, along all indoor food storage areas.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
17. Fly traps are placed as necessary, but not in direct view from outdoors so they do not attract pests from outdoors.  Explosive devices must not be located in food production areas and must be at least 20 feet from stored food or packaging. Non-explosive fly lights should not be located above exposed food, but can be located within 10 feet.<br />

<strong><span style="font-size: small;">EQUIPMENT AND PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PLAN: </span></strong><br />
Within online Food Safety Check List (which can be customized to your needs)<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
Buildings, fixtures, and other physical facilities of location shall be maintained in a sanitary condition and kept in repair sufficient to prevent food from becoming adulterated.  The preventative equipment maintenance program will be followed to ensure that equipment, which may impact food safety, functions as intended.  The maintenance procedures and frequencies are based on the equipment manufacturer&rsquo;s manuals or equivalent, or on operating conditions that could affect the performance of the equipment.  (<b>See online Food Safety Check List to customize to your establishment.  All equipment maintenance by equipment item can have a specific question assigned for safety check and notation of corrective actions.</b>)  A written calibration program will be followed, including calibration methods and frequencies.  (<b>Equipment calibration is recorded in online Food Safety Check List and for thermometers in the online Thermometer Calibration Log</b>)  Maintenance and calibration of equipment will be performed by appropriately trained personnel, and all work will be documented in the <b>online Food Safety Check List and Thermometer Calibration Log</b>.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
1. HACCP requires verification by a supervisor or higher level person that the maintenance task was performed fully.  This is accomplished by higher level authority signing and dating the logs and/or check lists of the completed maintenance or repair.<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
2. Thermostats and thermometers are accurately calibrated.  If temperature sensing bulbs on equipment are dirty, inaccurate temperature readings will be produced.  Dirt on refrigerator condensing coils or evaporator coils will decrease the effectiveness of the cooling units and increase energy expenditure.  Poorly maintained malfunctioning equipment is dangerous to employees and will result in the production of unsafe products. <br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
3. Instructions for using specific pieces of equipment are available to all personnel, in order that equipment is operated safely and maintained according to manufacturer directions.  Management personnel must also instruct (or question) new employees on the proper use and maintenance of equipment before any new employee is allowed to use it. <br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
4. Machine oil must be kept away from food.  If it gets into food, it will make people very sick.  Food grade lubricant must be used<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
5. Boiler chemicals must be food grade material<br />
</span></span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
6. Equipment is checked by a food production person after any maintenance and/or repair, because equipment repair specialists may not always have corrected the problem or set the controls properly.<br />
</span></span><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><br />
