    THE USE OF HACCP AS A FOOD SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    Since the 1960’s, food safety professionals have recognized the importance of HACCP principles <br />
    for controlling risk factors that directly contribute to foodborne illness.  The principles of HACCP<br /> 
    embody the concept of active managerial control by encouraging participation in a system that <br />
    ensures foodborne illness risk factors are controlled.  HACCP is not a stand-alone program, but is <br />
    built upon a foundation of operational practices called prerequisite programs.  The success of a<br /> 
    HACCP program (or plan) is dependent upon both facilities and people.  The facilities and <br />
    equipment should be designed to facilitate safe food preparation and handling practices by <br />
    employees. Furthermore, FDA recommends that managers and employees be properly motivated <br />
    and trained if a HACCP program is to successfully reduce the occurrence of foodborne illness risk <br />
    factors.  Instilling food worker and management commitment and dealing with problems like high<br /> 
    employee turnover and communication barriers should be considered when designing a food <br />
    safety management system based on HACCP principles.  Properly implemented, a food safety <br />
    management system based on HACCP principles may offer you the following other advantages:<br />

    <li>Reduction in product loss</li>
    <li>Increase in product quality</li>
    <li>Better control of product inventory</li>
    <li>Consistency in product preparation</li>
    <li>Increase in profit	</li>
    <li>Increase in employee awareness and participation in food safety</li>

    What are the seven HACCP principles?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    The 1997 National Advisory Committee for the Microbiological Criteria for Foods<br />
    (NACMCF) recommendations updated the seven HACCP principles to include the following:<br /><br />

    <b>1.	Perform a Hazard Analysis</b><br />
    The first principle is about understanding the operation and determining what food safety hazards <br />
    are likely to occur. The manager needs to understand how the people, equipment, methods, and <br />
    foods all affect each other.  The processes and procedures used to prepare the food are also <br />
    considered. This usually involves defining the operational steps (receiving, storage, preparation, <br />
    cooking, etc.) that occur as food enters and moves through the operation.  Additionally, this step <br />
    involves determining the control measures that can be used to eliminate, prevent, or reduce food <br />
    safety hazards. Control measures include such activities as implementation of employee health <br />
    policies to restrict or exclude ill employees and proper hand washing.<br /><br />

    <b>2.	Decide on the Critical Control Points (CCPs)</b><br />
    Once the control measures in principle #1 are determined, it is necessary to identify which of the <br />
    control measures are absolutely essential to ensuring safe food. An operational step where <br />
    control can be applied and is essential for ensuring that a food safety hazard is eliminated, <br />
    prevented or reduced to an acceptable level is a critical control point (CCP). When determining <br />
    whether a certain step is a CCP, if there is a later step that will prevent, reduce, or eliminate a <br />
    hazard to an acceptable level, then the former step is not a CCP. It is important to know that not <br />
    all steps are CCPs. Generally, there are only a few CCPs in each food preparation process<br /> 
    because CCPs involve only those steps that are absolutely essential to food safety.<br /><br />

    <b>3.	Determine the Critical Limits</b><br />
    Each CCP must have boundaries that define safety. Critical limits are the parameters that must <br />
    be achieved to control a food safety hazard. For example, when cooking pork chops, the Food <br />
    Code sets the critical limit at 145 ºF for 15 seconds. When critical limits are not met, the food may <br />
    not be safe. Critical limits are measurable and observable.<br /><br />

    <b>4.	Establish Procedures to Monitor CCPs</b><br />
    Once CCPs and critical limits have been determined, someone needs to keep track of the CCPs <br />
    as the food flows through the operation. Monitoring involves making direct observations or <br />
    measurements to see that the CCPs are kept under control by adhering to the established critical <br />
    limits.<br /><br />

    <b>5.	Establish Corrective Actions</b><br />
    While monitoring CCPs, occasionally the process or procedure will fail to meet the established <br />
    critical limits. This step establishes a plan for what happens when a critical limit has not been met <br />
    at a CCP. The operator decides what the actions will be, communicates those actions to the <br />
    employees, and trains them in making the right decisions. This preventive approach is the heart <br />
    of HACCP. Problems will arise, but you need to find them and correct them before they cause <br />
    illness or injury.<br /><br />

    <b>6.	Establish Verification Procedures</b><br />
    This principle is about making sure that the system is scientifically-sound to effectively control the <br />
    hazards. In addition, this step ensures that the system is operating according to what is specified <br />
    in the plan. Designated individuals like the manager periodically make observations of <br />
    employees’ monitoring activities, calibrate equipment and temperature measuring devices, review <br />
    records/actions, and discuss procedures with the employees. All of these activities are for the <br />
    purpose of ensuring that the HACCP plan is addressing the food safety concerns and, if not, <br />
    checking to see if it needs to be modified or improved.<br /><br />

    <b>7.	Establish a Record Keeping System</b><br />
    There are certain written records or kinds of documentation that are needed in order to verify that <br />
    the system is working. These records will normally involve the HACCP plan itself and any <br />
    monitoring, corrective action, or calibration records produced in the operation of the HACCP <br />
    system. Verification records may also be included. Records maintained in a HACCP system <br />
    serve to document that an ongoing, effective system is in place. Record keeping should be as <br />
    simple as possible in order to make it more likely that employees will have the time to keep the records.<br />

     How can HACCP principles be used in retail and food service operations?
     </div>
     <div class="GirdDiv">
   Within the retail and food service industries, the implementation of HACCP principles varies as <br />
   much as the products produced. The resources available to help you identify and control risk <br />
   factors common to your operation may also be limited. Due to this diversity, implementation of <br />
   “textbook” HACCP is impractical in most retail and food service establishments. Like many other <br />
   quality assurance programs, the principles of HACCP provide a common-sense approach to <br />
   identifying and controlling risk factors. Consequently, many food safety management systems at <br />
   the retail level incorporate some, if not all, of<br />
    the principles of HACCP. While a complete HACCP system is ideal, many different types of food <br />
    safety management systems may be implemented to control risk factors. It is also important to <br />
    recognize that HACCP has no single correct application. Variations in the procedures presented <br />
    with HACCP Builder are appropriate as long as they are based on sound public health judgment. <br />
    In addition to the material presented in the HACCP Builder program, several references have <br />
    been provided to assist you in developing a food safety management system specific to your operation.
