    APPLYING HACCP PRINCIPLES TO RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICE

    What are the retail and food service industries?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    Since the early 1980’s, retail and food service operators and regulators have been exploring the <br />
    use of HACCP in restaurants, grocery stores, and other retail food establishments. Most of this <br />
    exploration has centered on the question of how to stay true to the definitions of HACCP yet still <br />
    make the principles useful to an industry that encompasses a very broad range of conditions. <br />
    Through this exploration, HACCP principles have been slightly modified to apply to the varied <br />
    operations found at retail.  When conducting the hazard analysis, food manufacturers usually use <br />
    food commodities as an organizational tool and follow the flow of one product. This is a very <br />
    useful approach for producers or processors since they are usually handling one product at a <br />
    time. By contrast, in retail and food service operations, foods of all types are worked together to<br /> 
    produce the final product. This makes a different approach to the hazard analysis necessary. <br />
    Conducting the hazard analysis by using the food preparation processes common to a specific <br />
    operation is often more efficient and useful for retail and food service operators. This is called the <br />
    "Process Approach" to HACCP.  The process approach can best be described as dividing the<br />
    many food flows in an establishment into broad categories based on activities or stages in the<br /> 
    flow of food through your establishment, then analyzing the hazards, and placing managerial <br />
    controls on each grouping

    What is the process approach?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
   The flow of food in a retail or food service establishment is the path that food follows from <br />
   receiving through service or sale to the consumer. Several activities or stages make up the flow <br />
   of food and are called operational steps. Examples of operational steps include receiving, storing, <br />
   preparing, cooking, cooling, reheating, holding, assembling, packaging, serving, and selling. Keep <br />
   in mind that the terminology used for operational steps may differ between food service and retail <br />
   food store operations.

    What are the four food preparation processes most often used in retail and food service establishments?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    Most food items produced in a retail or food service establishment can be categorized into one of <br />
    three preparation processes based on the number of times the food passes through the <br />
    temperature danger zone between 41 ºF to 135 ºF:<br /><br />
    
    <b>Process 0: No Food Preparation and No Cook Step<br />
    Example flow: Receive – Store – Hold – Serve<br /></b>
    (other food flows are included in this process, but there is no cook step to destroy
    pathogens)<br /><br />

    <b>Process 1: Food Preparation with No Cook Step<br />
    Example flow: Receive – Store – Prepare – Hold – Serve</b><br />
    (other food flows are included in this process, but there is no cook step to destroy
    pathogens)<br /><br />

    <b>Process 2: Preparation for Same Day Service<br />
    Example flow: Receive – Store – Prepare – Cook – Hold – Serve</b><br />
    (other food flows are included in this process, but there is only one trip through
    the temperature danger zone)<br /><br />

    <b>Process 3: Complex Food Preparation<br />
    Example flow: Receive – Store – Prepare – Cook – Cool – Reheat – Hot
    Hold – Serve</b><br />
    (other food flows are included in this process, but there are always two or more
    complete trips through the temperature danger zone)<br /><br />

    <br />
    A summary of the three food preparation processes in terms of number of times through the <br />
    temperature danger zone can be depicted in a Danger Zone diagram.  Note that while foods <br />
    produced using process 1 may enter the danger zone, they are neither cooked to destroy <br />
    pathogens, nor are they hot held. Foods that go through the danger zone only once are classified <br />
    as Same Day Service, while foods that go through more than once are classified as Complex <br />
    food preparation.  The three food preparation processes conducted in retail and food service <br />
    establishments are not intended to be all-inclusive. For instance, quick service facilities may have <br />
    “cook and serve” processes specific to their operation. These processes are likely to be different <br />
    from the “Same Day Service” preparation processes in full service restaurants since many of their <br />
    foods are generally cooked and hot held before service.  In addition, in retail food stores, <br />
    operational steps such as packaging and assembly may be included in all of the food preparation <br />
    processes prior to being sold to the consumer.  It is also very common for a retail or food service <br />
    operator to have a single menu item (i.e. chicken salad sandwich) that is created by combining <br />
    several components produced using more than one kind of food preparation process. It is <br />
    important for you to remember that even though variations of the three food preparation process <br />
    flows are common, the control measures – actions or activities that can be used to prevent, <br />
    eliminate, or reduce food safety hazards – to be implemented in each process will generally be <br />
    the same based on the number of times the food goes through the temperature danger zone.<br />
