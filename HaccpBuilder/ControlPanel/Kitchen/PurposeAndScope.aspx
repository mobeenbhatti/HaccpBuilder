    "Foodborne illness in the United States is a major cause of personal distress, preventable death,<br />
    and avoidable economic burden. Mead et al. (1999) estimated that foodborne diseases cause 76 <br />
    million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each year…The <br />
    annual cost of foodborne illness in terms of pain and suffering, reduced productivity, and medical<br />
    costs is estimated to be $10-83 billion.”<br />
    <u>2001 Food Code, Public Health Service - Food & Drug Administration<br />
    U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</u><br />
    	<br />
    The statistics on foodborne illness speak for themselves. Regulatory officials and the retail and<br />
    food service industries they regulate must partner with each other if we are to prevent or reduce<br />
    foodborne illness. This food safety process approach was developed by the United States Food<br />
    and Drug Administration (FDA), in partnership with federal, state, and local regulators, industry,<br /> 
    academia, and consumers, to assist you, the operators of retail and food service establishments, <br />
    in your efforts to produce safe food.<br /> <a href="#top" style="color:Blue;"> Back to Top</a>

    Who has the responsibility for ensuring safe food?

    <div class="GirdDiv">
    “Delivering safe food to the dinner table is the culmination of the work of many people. <br /> 
    Producers, shippers, processors, distributors, handlers, and numerous others perform actions <br />
    every day that may affect the safety of our food. Everyone's challenge is to perform these <br />
    individual actions as well as possible, so that the food Americans eat is free from physical <br />
    hazards and dangerous levels of pathogenic microorganisms and hazardous chemicals.”<br />

    While every player in the flow of food from farm to table has some degree of responsibility for <br />
    food safety, you are usually the last line of defense before food reaches the consumer. Because <br />
    of this, you have a significant share of the responsibility for ensuring safe food. By voluntarily <br />
    developing a food safety management system, you can better ensure that the foods served or <br />
    sold in your establishment are safe <a href="#top" style="color:Blue;"> Back to Top</a>

    What is my health inspector’s role in helping me to prevent foodborne illness in my establishment?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    Regulatory food inspection programs provide you with feedback on how well you are controlling <br />
    certain conditions in your establishment that can lead to foodborne illness. Although your<br />
    inspector can offer suggestions for how you can improve conditions in your establishment; he or <br />
    she cannot possibly oversee every activity or function in your day-to-day operation.  Given this <br />
    limitation, you clearly have the greatest impact on food safety <a href="#top" style="color:Blue;"> Back to Top</a><br />

    How can this program help me to prevent foodborne illness?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
   “Voluntary approaches can complement regulatory programs, particularly where government <br />
    actions enhance existing incentives for individuals to adopt practices that increase food safety. <br />
    Other approaches rely on the power of information to influence behavior. Such voluntary, <br />
    prevention-oriented approaches will have a greater chance of success if they are promoted in <br />
    partnership with the affected stakeholders”<br />
    <u>2001 Food Safety Strategic Plan<br />
    The President’s Council on Food Safety</u><br /><br />

    The HACCP Builder program provides you with a “roadmap” for writing and voluntarily <br />
    implementing a food safety management system based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control <br />
    Point (HACCP) principles. By voluntarily developing and implementing a food safety management <br />
    system like the one HACCP Builder can provide, you can take a proactive role in ensuring the <br />
    food served or sold in your establishment is safe.  Rather than responding to a foodborne illness <br />
    when it occurs, you can prevent it by taking active steps to eliminate, prevent, or reduce to an <br />
    acceptable level food safety hazards that cause someone to be sick or injured.<br /><br />

    If you already have an existing food safety management system, you may use the HACCP <br />
    Builder to upgrade the system you have in place. Whether you are developing a new food safety <br />
    management system or merely upgrading the one you currently have, this program encourages <br />
    operators and regulators of retail and food service to partner together to make the greatest impact <br />
    on food safety. <a href="#top" style="color:Blue;"> Back to Top</a><br />

    How was the HACCP program developed?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    The HACCP Builder procedures and information presented were established based on the <br />
    guidelines developed from the results of FDA food safety seminars and Food Safety Initiative <br />
    grassroots meetings. In addition, the Conference for Food Protection (CFP) has reviewed and <br />
    endorsed the contents of this program.  <a href="#top" style="color:Blue;"> Back to Top</a><br />

    Who regulates me?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    Although the contents of the HACCP Builder program were adapted by the guidance document <br />
    developed by the FDA, your respective state, local, or tribal government directly regulates your <br />
    specific operation. Understand that the requirements of your regulatory authority may not be the <br />
    same as what is recommended in the model FDA Food Code.  The 2001 FDA Food Code is used <br />
    as the basis of this program, but it is neither federal law nor federal regulation. It also does not <br />
    supersede the requirements of your state, local, or tribal government. However, most states have <br />
    adopted the Food Code to regulate retail and food service establishments under their jurisdiction <br />
    since it represents FDA's best advice for a uniform system of regulation to ensure that food at <br />
    retail is safe and properly protected and presented. With this in mind, you should compare the <br />
    requirements of your state, local, or tribal government with any Food Code requirements <br />
    mentioned in this Manual to make sure they are consistent with one another <a href="#top" style="color:Blue;"> Back to Top</a><br />
    </div>
    <div id="6" class="Heading">
    Is it a requirement that I implement a food safety management system based on HACCP principles?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    The Food Code clearly establishes that the implementation of HACCP at retail should be a <br />
    voluntary effort by industry. If, however, you plan on conducting certain specialized<br />
    processes that carry considerably high risk, you should consult your regulatory authority to see if <br />
    you are required to have a HACCP plan.  The expectations for a product usually in terms of the <br />
    number of disease-causing microorganisms that need to be destroyed through a process.  For <br />
    example, instead of cooking chicken to 165 ºF for 15 seconds as dictated in the Food Code, <br />
    performance standards allow you to use a different combination of time and temperature as long <br />
    as the same level of public safety is achieved. Use of performance standards allows you to use <br />
    innovative approaches in producing safe products.  When using performance standards or when <br />
    conducting other specialized processes, the FDA Food Code requires an establishment to obtain <br />
    a variance, or exemption from the requirements of the Code, and to implement a more <br />
    comprehensive HACCP plan.  The regulatory authority must not only approve this HACCP plan,<br /> 
    but records generated in support of the plan must be made available for review when requested.<br />
    Jurisdictions that have not adopted the Food Code, but otherwise allow the use of performance <br />
    standards or other specialized processing methods, may also require you to obtain a variance. In <br />
    such cases, the regulatory authority may also require that you develop a more comprehensive <br />
    HACCP plan.  In some jurisdictions around the country, the implementation of HACCP programs <br />
    is a requirement regardless of the processing methods used.  You should consult your regulatory <br />
    authority if you are unsure of your requirements, if you plan on deviating from the requirements, <br />
    or if you plan on conducting specialized processes.<a href="#top" style="color:Blue;"> Back to Top</a><br /><br />
