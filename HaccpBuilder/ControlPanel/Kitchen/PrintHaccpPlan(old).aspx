� On Monday, 8/1/05, lasagna is cooked, properly cooled, and refrigerated with a label that reads, �Lasagna, Cooked, 8/1/05.�
� On Tuesday, 8/2/05, the lasagna is frozen with a second label that reads, �Frozen, 8/2/05.� Two labels now appear on the lasagna. Since the lasagna was held under refrigeration from Monday, 8/1/05 � Tuesday, 8/2/05, only 1 day is counted towards the 7-day time period.
� On Tuesday 8/16/05 the lasagna is pulled out of the freezer. A third label is placed on the lasagna that reads, �Thawed, 8/16/05.� All three labels now appear on the lasagna. The lasagna must be served or discarded within 6 days.

MONITORING:
1. A designated employee will check refrigerators daily to verify that foods are date marked and that foods exceeding the 7-day time period are not being used or stored.

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
1. Retrain any foodservice employee found not following the procedures in this SOP.

2. Foods that are not date marked or that exceed the 7-day time period will be discarded.
