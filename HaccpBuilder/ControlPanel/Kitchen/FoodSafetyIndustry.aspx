    What are the retail and food service industries?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    Unlike many food processing operations, the retail and food service industries are not easily <br />
    defined by specific commodities or conditions. These establishments share the following characteristics:<br />

    1.	These industries have a wide range of employee resources, from highly trained executive <br />
    chefs to entry-level front line employees. Employees may have a broad range of <br />
    education levels and communication skills. It may be difficult to conduct in-house training <br />
    and maintain a trained staff because employees may speak different languages or there <br />
    may be high employee turnover.<br /><br />

    2.	Many are start-up businesses operating without the benefit of a large corporate support <br />
    structure. Having a relatively low profit margin means they may have less money to work <br />
    with than other segments of the food industry.<br /><br />

    3.	There is an almost endless number of production techniques, products, menu items, and <br />
    ingredients used. Suppliers, ingredients, menu items, and specifications may change frequently.<br />
<br />
    The following is a partial listing of the types of businesses that are usually considered part of the retail <br />
    and food service industries:

    <li>Back-country guided trips for groups</li>
    <li>Health care facilities</li>
    <li>Bakeries</li>
    <li>Interstate conveyances</li>
    <li>Bed and breakfast operations</li>

    What are food safety hazards?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    Hazards are biological, physical, or chemical properties that may cause food to be unsafe for <br />
    human consumption. The goal of a food safety management system is to control certain factors <br />
    that lead to out-of-control hazards.  Because many foods are agricultural products and have <br />
    started their journey to your door as animals and plants raised in the environment, they may <br />
    contain microscopic organisms. Some of these organisms are pathogens, which means that <br />
    under the right conditions and in the right numbers, they can make someone who eats them sick. <br />
    Raw animal foods such as meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, and eggs often carry bacteria, viruses, or <br />
    parasites that can be harmful to humans.  Food can become contaminated by toxic chemicals or <br />
    toxins in your establishment or in the environment. Physical objects may also contaminate food <br />
    and cause injury.  Food may become naturally contaminated from the soil in which it is grown or <br />
    from harvest, storage, or transportation practices.  Some foods undergo further processing and at <br />
    times, despite best efforts, become contaminated.  These inherent hazards, along with the hazards that <br />
    may be introduced in your establishment such as metal fragments from grinding can <br />
    lead to injury, illness, or death.  Hazards are a huge threat to your business. Think of hazards as <br />
    ticking bombs in your establishment. Unless they are kept under control, they could result in <br />
    financial ruin for your business.<br />

Hazards include:
<li>Biological agents</li>
<li>Bacteria and their toxins</li>
<li>Parasites</li>
<li>Viruses</li>
<li>Physical Objects</li>
<li>Bandages</li>
<li>Jewelry</li>
<li>Stones</li>
<li>Glass</li>
<li>Bone and metal fragments</li>
<li>Packaging materials</li>
<li>Chemical Contamination</li>
<li>Natural plant and animal toxins</li>
<li>Unlabeled allergens (allergen-causing protein)</li>
<li>Nonfood-grade lubricants</li>
<li>Cleaning compounds</li>
<li>Food additives</li>
<li>Insecticides</li>

    What are foodborne illness risk factors?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Surveillance Report for 1993-1997, <br />
    “Surveillance for Foodborne-Disease Outbreaks – United States,” identifies the most significant <br />
    contributing factors to foodborne illness. Five of these broad categories of contributing factors <br />
    directly relate to food safety concerns within retail and food service establishments and are <br />
    collectively termed by the FDA as “foodborne illness risk factors.” These five broad categories are:

<li>Food from Unsafe Sources</li>
<li>Inadequate Cooking</li>
<li>Improper Holding Temperatures</li>
<li>Contaminated Equipment</li>
<li>Poor Personal Hygiene</li>
<br />
No national baseline on the occurrence of foodborne illness risk factors was available until 2000 <br />
when FDA released the Report of the FDA Retail Food Program Database of Foodborne Illness <br />
Risk Factors. The report, commonly referred to as the “FDA Baseline Report,” is provided to <br />
regulators and industry with the expectation that it will be used to focus greater attention and <br />
increased resources on the control of foodborne illness risk factors. A copy of the report is <br />
available from FDA through the following website:<br />

http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/retrsk.html.<br />
<br />
Based on the measurable trends identified in CDC’s 1993-1997 Surveillance Report and in FDA’s <br />
Baseline Report, FDA recommends that your food safety management system focus on <br />
establishing active managerial control of the five CDC-identified risk factors.<br />

    What is meant by active managerial control?
    </div>
    <div class="GirdDiv">
    The term “active managerial control” is used extensively throughout this program to describe your <br /> 
    role for developing and implementing a food safety management system to reduce the  <br /> 
    occurrence of risk factors. Although the term “active managerial control” may be new to some, the  <br /> 
    basic management principles are probably already being used in your day-to-day operations.   <br /> 
    Active managerial control means the purposeful incorporation of specific actions or procedures by  <br /> 
    industry management into the operation of your business to attain control over foodborne illness  <br /> 
    risk factors.  It embodies a preventive rather than reactive approach to food safety.  Having active  <br /> 
    managerial control includes having procedures in place for controlling identified foodborne illness  <br /> 
    risk factors through a continuous system of monitoring and verification.  FDA recognizes that  <br /> 
    there are many management systems that you can voluntarily implement to achieve active  <br /> 
    managerial control of risk factors. This Manual focuses only on the voluntary implementation of <br />  
    HACCP principles in your food safety management system. Regardless of the system you use,  <br /> 
    effective elements of a food safety management system may include:

    <li>Certified food protection managers who have shown a proficiency of required 
    information by passing a test that is part of an accredited program</li>
    <li>Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for performing critical operational 
    steps in a food preparation process such as cooling</li>
    <li>Recipe cards that contain the specific steps for preparing a food item and the 
    food safety critical limits such as final cooking temperatures that need to be 
    monitored and verified</li>
    <li>Purchase specifications</li>
    <li>Equipment and facility design and maintenance</li>
    <li>Monitoring procedures</li>
    <li>Record keeping</li>
    <li>Employee health policy for restricting or excluding ill employees</li>
    <li>Manager and employee training</li>
    <li>On-going quality control and assurance</li>
    <li>Specific goal-oriented plans, like Risk Control Plans (RCPs), that outline</li>
    procedures for controlling specific foodborne illness risk factors
